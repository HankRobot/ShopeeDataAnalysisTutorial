The rules defined can be very simple to very complex. The bots can handle simple queries but fail to manage complex ones.\n# Self-learning bots \n    are the ones that use some Machine Learning-based approaches and are definitely more efficient than rule-based bots. These bots can be of further two types: Retrieval Based or Generative\ni) In retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages. The context can include a current position in the dialogue tree, all previous messages in the conversation, previously saved variables (e.g. username). Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers.\nii) Generative bots can generate the answers and not always replies with one of the answers from a set of answers. This makes them more intelligent as they take word by word from the query and generates the answers."

However, Machine learning algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the task. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for work. Basic text pre-processing includes:\n1. Converting the entire text into uppercase or lowercase, so that the algorithm does not treat the same words in different cases as different\n2. Tokenization: Tokenization is just the term used to describe the process of converting the normal text strings into a list of tokens i.e words that we actually want. Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings. The NLTK data package includes a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.\n3. Removing Noise i.e everything that isn’t in a standard number or letter.\n4. Removing Stop words. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words\n5. Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: “Stems”, “Stemming”, “Stemmed”, “and Stemtization”, the result would be a single word “stem”.\n6. Lemmatization: A slight variant of stemming is lemmatization. The major difference between these is, that, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words. So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.\n\n\n "

The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n\n* A vocabulary of known words.\n\n* A measure of the presence of known words.\n\nWhy is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only **concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.**\n\nThe intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.\n\nFor example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).\n\n\n### TF-IDF Approach\nA problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content”. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter documents.\n\nOne approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized. This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:\n\n**Term Frequency: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.**\n\n```\nTF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)\n```\n\n**Inverse Document Frequency: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.**\n\n```\nIDF = 1+log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.\n```\n\n# Example:\n\n    Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word ‘phone’ appears 5 times.\n1. The term frequency (i.e., tf) for phone is then (5 / 100) = 0.05. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word phone appears in one thousand of these. \n2. The inverse document frequency (i.e., IDF) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, \n3. The Tf-IDF weight is the product of these quantities: 0.05 * 4 = 0.20.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Cosine Similarity\n\nTf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus\n\n```\nCosine Similarity (d1, d2) =  Dot product(d1, d2) / ||d1|| * ||d2||\n```\nwhere d1,d2 are two non zero vectors.\n\n"
