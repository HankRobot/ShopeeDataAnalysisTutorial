    "# How do Chatbots work?\n",
    "There are broadly two variants of chatbots: \n",
    "    Rule-Based and Self-learning.\n",
    "# In a Rule-based approach, \n",
    "    a bot answers questions based on some rules on which it is trained on. The rules defined can be very simple to very complex. The bots can handle simple queries but fail to manage complex ones.\n",
    "# Self-learning bots \n",
    "    are the ones that use some Machine Learning-based approaches and are definitely more efficient than rule-based bots. These bots can be of further two types: Retrieval Based or Generative\n",
    "i) In retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages. The context can include a current position in the dialogue tree, all previous messages in the conversation, previously saved variables (e.g. username). Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers.\n",
    "ii) Generative bots can generate the answers and not always replies with one of the answers from a set of answers. This makes them more intelligent as they take word by word from the query and generates the answers."

    "\n",
    "    The main issue with text data is that it is all in text format (strings). However, Machine learning algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the task. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for work. Basic text pre-processing includes:\n",
    "1. Converting the entire text into uppercase or lowercase, so that the algorithm does not treat the same words in different cases as different\n",
    "2. Tokenization: Tokenization is just the term used to describe the process of converting the normal text strings into a list of tokens i.e words that we actually want. Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings. The NLTK data package includes a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.\n",
    "3. Removing Noise i.e everything that isn’t in a standard number or letter.\n",
    "4. Removing Stop words. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words\n",
    "5. Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: “Stems”, “Stemming”, “Stemmed”, “and Stemtization”, the result would be a single word “stem”.\n",
    "6. Lemmatization: A slight variant of stemming is lemmatization. The major difference between these is, that, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words. So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.\n",

      "\n",
      "the term \"chatterbot\" was originally coined by michael mauldin (creator of the first verbot, julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as google assistant and amazon alexa, via messaging apps such as facebook messenger or wechat, or via individual organizations' apps and websites. chatbots can be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat), analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, hr, marketing, news, personal, productivity, shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.\n",
      "background\n",
      "in 1950, alan turing's famous article \"computing machinery and intelligence\" was published, which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence. this criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliablyï¿½on the basis of the conversational content aloneï¿½between the program and a real human. the notoriety of turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in joseph weizenbaum's program eliza, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. however weizenbaum himself did not claim that eliza was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:\n",
      "\n",
      "[in] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. but once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... the observer says to himself \"i could have written that\". with that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios ... the object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". few programs ever needed it more.\n",
      "\n",
      "eliza's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of cue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'mother' with 'tell me more about your family').thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. eliza showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as \"intelligent\".\n",
      "\n",
      "interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversationalï¿½even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matchingï¿½can be exploited for useful purposes. most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. this sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from weizenbaum's \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".\n",
      "\n",
      "development\n",
      "the classic historic early chatbots are eliza (1966) and parry (1972).more recent notable programs include a.l.i.c.e., jabberwacky and d.u.d.e (agence nationale de la recherche and cnrs 2006). while eliza and parry were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities. in 1984, a book called the policeman's beard is half constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).\n",
      "\n",
      "one pertinent field of ai research is natural language processing. usually, weak ai fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. for example, a.l.i.c.e. uses a markup language called aiml, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, alicebots. nevertheless, a.l.i.c.e. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique eliza was using back in 1966. this is not strong ai, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "chatbot competitions focus on the turing test or more specific goals. two such annual contests are the loebner prize and the chatterbox challenge (offline since 2015, materials can still be found from web archives).\n",

for useful purposes.\", 'most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories.', 'thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system.', 'this sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from weizenbaum\\'s \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".', 'development\\nthe classic historic early chatbots are eliza (1966) and parry (1972).more recent notable programs include a.l.i.c.e., jabberwacky and d.u.d.e (agence nationale de la recherche and cnrs 2006).', 'while eliza and parry were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities.', \"in 1984, a book called the policeman's beard is half constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).\", 'one pertinent field of ai research is natural language processing.', 'usually, weak ai fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required.', 'for example, a.l.i.c.e.', 'uses a markup language called aiml, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, alicebots.', 'nevertheless, a.l.i.c.e.', 'is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique eliza was using back in 1966. this is not strong ai, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.', 'jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database.', 'some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held.', 'still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.', 'chatbot competitions focus on the turing test or more specific goals.', 'two such annual contests are the loebner prize and the chatterbox challenge (offline since 2015, materials can still be found from web archives).', 'according to forrester (2015), ai will replace 16 percent of american jobs by the end of the decade.chatbots have been used in applications such as customer service, sales and product education.', 'however, a study conducted by narrative science in 2015 found that 80 percent of their respondents believe ai improves worker performance and creates jobs.', \"[citation needed]\\n\\napplication\\nsee also: virtual assistant\\n\\naeromexico airline chatbot running on facebook messenger,

sms.\", 'they are used for b2c customer service, sales and marketing.', 'in 2016, facebook messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform.', 'there were 30,000 bots created for

can sometimes act as participants in a group chat.\", 'many banks and insurers, media and e-commerce companies, airlines and hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement,for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them.', 'a 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.according to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.\\n\\nas part of company apps and websites\\nprevious generations of chatbots were present on company

chatbot named mila to automate certain simple yet time-consuming processes when requesting for a sick leave.other large companies such as lloyds banking group, royal bank of scotland, renault and citroï¿½n are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact.', 'a saas chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the f8 conference when zuckerberg unveiled that messenger would allow chatbots into the app.', 'toys\\nchatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing such as toys.', \"hello barbie is an internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company toytalk,which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.these characters' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.\", \"ibm's watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as cognitoys intended to interact with children for educational purposes.\", 'chatbot creation\\nthe process of creating a chatbot follows a pattern similar to the development of a web page or a mobile app.', 'it can be divided into design, building, analytics and maintenance.', 'design\\nthe chatbot design is the process that defines the interaction between the user and the chatbot.the chatbot designer will define the chatbot personality, the questions that will be asked to the users, and the overall interaction.it can be viewed as a subset of the conversational design.', 'in order to speed up this process, designers can use dedicated chatbot design tools, that allow for immediate preview, team collaboration and video export.an important part of the chatbot design is also centered around user testing.', 'user testing can be performed following the same principles that guide the user testing of graphical interfaces.', \"building\\nthe process of building a chatbot can be divided into two main tasks: understanding the user's intent and producing the correct answer.\", 'the first task involves understanding the user input.', 'in order to properly understand a user input in a free text form, a natural language processing engine can be used.the second task may involve different approaches depending on the type of the response that the chatbot will generate.', 'analytics\\nthe usage of the chatbot can be monitored in order to spot potential flaws or problems.', 'it can also provide useful insights that can improve the final user experience.', 'maintenance\\nto keep chatbots up to speed with changing company products and services, traditional chatbot development platforms require ongoing maintenance.', 'this can either be in the form of an ongoing service provider or for larger enterprises in the form of an in-house chatbot training team.to eliminate these costs, some startups are experimenting with artificial intelligence to develop self-learning chatbots, particularly in customer service applications.', 'chatbot development platforms\\nthe process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud based chatbot development platforms offered by cloud platform as a service (paas) providers such as yekaliva, oracle cloud platform, snatchbot and ibm watson.these cloud platforms provide natural language processing, artificial intelligence and mobile backend as a service for chatbot development.', 'apis\\nthere are many apis available for building your own chatbots, such as aarc.', 'malicious use\\nmalicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behaviour and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers.', 'they are commonly found on yahoo!', 'messenger, windows live messenger, aol instant messenger and other instant messaging protocols.', \"there

    "### Bag of Words\n",
    "After the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A vocabulary of known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A measure of the presence of known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only **concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make the bag-of-words model concrete with a worked example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Collect Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a snippet of the first few lines of text from the book “A Tale of Two Cities” by Charles Dickens, taken from Project Gutenberg.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the best of times,\n",
    "it was the worst of times,\n",
    "it was the age of wisdom,\n",
    "it was the age of foolishness,\n",
    "\n",
    "For this small example, let’s treat each line as a separate “document” and the 4 lines as our entire corpus of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Design the Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can make a list of all of the words in our model vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique words here (ignoring case and punctuation) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "“it”\n",
    "“was”\n",
    "“the”\n",
    "“best”\n",
    "“of”\n",
    "“times”\n",
    "“worst”\n",
    "“age”\n",
    "“wisdom”\n",
    "“foolishness”\n",
    "That is a vocabulary of 10 words from a corpus containing 24 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Create Document Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to score the words in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to turn each document of free text into a vector that we can use as input or output for a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we know the vocabulary has 10 words, we can use a fixed-length document representation of 10, with one position in the vector to score each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest scoring method is to mark the presence of words as a boolean value, 0 for absent, 1 for present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the arbitrary ordering of words listed above in our vocabulary, we can step through the first document (“It was the best of times“) and convert it into a binary vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring of the document would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "“it” = 1\n",
    "“was” = 1\n",
    "“the” = 1\n",
    "“best” = 1\n",
    "“of” = 1\n",
    "“times” = 1\n",
    "“worst” = 0\n",
    "“age” = 0\n",
    "“wisdom” = 0\n",
    "“foolishness” = 0\n",
    "As a binary vector, this would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "The other three documents would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "\"it was the worst of times\" = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "\"it was the age of wisdom\" = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n",
    "\"it was the age of foolishness\" = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "All ordering of the words is nominally discarded and we have a consistent way of extracting features from any document in our corpus, ready for use in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "New documents that overlap with the vocabulary of known words, but may contain words outside of the vocabulary, can still be encoded, where only the occurrence of known words are scored and unknown words are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how this might naturally scale to large vocabularies and larger documents.\n",

    "A problem with scoring word frequency is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content” to the model as rarer but perhaps domain specific words.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents, so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:\n",

    "IDF = 1+log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word ‘phone’ appears 5 times.\n",
    "1. The term frequency (i.e., tf) for phone is then (5 / 100) = 0.05. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word phone appears in one thousand of these. \n",
    "2. The inverse document frequency (i.e., IDF) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, \n",
