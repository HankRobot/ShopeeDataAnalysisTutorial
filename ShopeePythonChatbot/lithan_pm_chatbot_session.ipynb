    "There are broadly two variants of chatbots: \n",
    "    Rule-Based and Self-learning.\n",
    "# In a Rule-based approach, \n",
    "    a bot answers questions based on some rules on which it is trained on. The rules defined can be very simple to very complex. The bots can handle simple queries but fail to manage complex ones.\n",
    "# Self-learning bots \n",
    "    are the ones that use some Machine Learning-based approaches and are definitely more efficient than rule-based bots. These bots can be of further two types: Retrieval Based or Generative\n",
    "i) In retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages. The context can include a current position in the dialogue tree, all previous messages in the conversation, previously saved variables (e.g. username). Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers.\n",
    "ii) Generative bots can generate the answers and not always replies with one of the answers from a set of answers. This makes them more intelligent as they take word by word from the query and generates the answers."

Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings. The NLTK data package includes a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A vocabulary of known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A measure of the presence of known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only **concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Design the Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can make a list of all of the words in our model vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique words here (ignoring case and punctuation) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "“it”\n",

    "Because we know the vocabulary has 10 words, we can use a fixed-length document representation of 10, with one position in the vector to score each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest scoring method is to mark the presence of words as a boolean value, 0 for absent, 1 for present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the arbitrary ordering of words listed above in our vocabulary, we can step through the first document (“It was the best of times“) and convert it into a binary vector.\n",

    "“best” = 1\n",

    "“times” = 1\n",
    "“worst” = 0\n",
    "“age” = 0\n",
    "“wisdom” = 0\n",
